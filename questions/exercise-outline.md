> At some point, encourage kids to create a folder/`main.py` file for each exercise.

1. Data types
    - Show `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`
    - Have the kids write one of each data type (no printing yet)
2. Displaying data
    - Show how to use `print()` to display raw `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool` data
    to the screen
3. Variables
    - Emphasize that variables allow us to *remember* data
    - Have the kids create variables of `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`
4. Building `str` with variables (`f-strings`)
    - Show how we can inject variables into a `str` using `f-strings` 
    - Kids can build a variable containing the `f-string` or print the raw
    `f-string`
5. Basic Arithmetic Operators
    - Have the kids use one of each of the 4 basic arithmetic operators
    - No printing or `f-strings` here
6. Project 1
    - Get creative and print a table of addition, subtraction, division, times tables
        - Use 10 (+, -, /, *) [1-5] as the operations
    - There's no "correct" answer here, the idea is to use multiple `print()` statements, 
    `f-strings`, and the arithmetic operators to create a pretty output that shows tables
    of arithmetic operations 
    - Can show a few example outputs to shoot for
7. User Input
    - Introduce `input()` as a way to get information from the user
    - Show `int()` and `float()` conversions
8. Conditional Statements - Part 1
    - Show simple `if`, `elif`, `else` conditional statements
9. Conditional Statements - Part 2
    - Show complex conditional statements
10. Loops - Part 1
    - Show `while` loops
11. User-defined functions - Part 1
    - Show how to define a function
12. User-defined functions - Part 2
    - Show how to use parameters and return values from functions
13. Project 2
    - Get creative using loops/user input, conditional statements, and functions.
    - Come up with a broad-themed app for kids to tackle that gives them enough
    leeway to be creative but also has enough structure to get consistent results.

# Exercise Outline

## Exercise 1 - Data types
- Show `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`
- Have the kids write one of each data type (no printing yet)

## Exercise 2 -  Displaying data
- Show how to use `print()` to display raw `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool` data
to the screen

## Exercise 3 - Variables
- Emphasize that variables allow us to *remember* data
- Have the kids create variables of `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`

## Exercise 4 - Building `str` with variables (`f-strings`)
- Show how we can inject variables into a `str` using `f-strings` 
- Kids can build a variable containing the `f-string` or print the raw
`f-string`

## Exercise 5 - Basic Arithmetic Operators
- Have the kids use one of each of the 4 basic arithmetic operators
- No printing or `f-strings` here

## Exercise 6 - Project 1
- Get creative and print a table of addition, subtraction, division, times tables
    - Use 10 (`+, -, /, *`) [1-5] as the operations
- There's no "correct" answer here, the idea is to use multiple `print()` statements, 
`f-strings`, and the arithmetic operators to create a pretty output that shows tables
of arithmetic operations 
- Can show a few example outputs to shoot for

## Exercise 7 - User Input
- Introduce `input()` as a way to get information from the user
- Show `int()` and `float()` conversions

## Exercise 8 - Conditional Statements - Part 1
- Show simple `if`, `elif`, `else` conditional statements

## Exercise 9 -  Conditional Statements - Part 2
- Show complex conditional statements

## Exercise 10 - `while` Loops
- Show `while` loops

## Exercise 11 - Modules 
- Show how to import and use modules from the Python standard library
- Mainly concerned with use `random` here.

## Exercise 12 - User-defined functions - Part 1
- Show how to define a function

## Exercise 13 - User-defined functions - Part 2
- Show how to use parameters and return values from functions

## Exercise 14 -  Project 2
- Get creative using loops/user input, conditional statements, and functions.
- Come up with a broad-themed app for kids to tackle that gives them enough
leeway to be creative but also has enough structure to get consistent results.

## Exercise 15 - Lists
- Creating them, indexing

## Exercise 16 - List methods
- For adding/removing items.

## Exercise 17 - `for` loops - Part 1
- Show how to loop through `lists` with `for` loops

## Exercise 18 - `for` loops - Part 2
- Show how to perform counter-controlled repetition with `for` and `range()`

## Exercise 19 - Dictionaries - Part 1
- Basic syntax and usage

## Exercise 20 - Dictionaries - Part 2
- Looping and methods

## Exercise 21 - Project 4


### Ideas

- At some point, encourage kids to create a folder/`main.py` file for each exercise.
    - They can submit this along with their work so other students can see the running project.
- Add docs links to all exercises so students have additional hints.
- Add links to a running version of all exercises with output so students can poke it while working.

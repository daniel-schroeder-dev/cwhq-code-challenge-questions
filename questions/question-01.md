# 2022 Code Challenge - Question 01 - Data Types

## Explanation 

Programs are made up of data. Each piece of data has a type, and we'll focus on 4 data types in the
first few exercises of this challenge. 

The four data types we'll use are:
- Strings (`str`)
- Integers (`int`)
- Decimal Numbers (`float`)
- Booleans (`bool`)

Here are examples of each data type:

```python
"Strings are text data enclosed in double-qoutes"
'You can also use single-quotes, but we will not in this challenge'

# Comments start with a `#` and can be used to make notes for yourself while programming.
# We'll use comments a lot in this challenge!

42  # This is an `int`. 

3.14  # This is a `float`.

True   # This is a `bool`.
False  # And so is this, there are only two `bool` data types: True and False.
```

## Exercise

Using what you learned in the above *Explanation*, create the following pieces of data:
1. A `str` containing your first name.
2. An `int` containing the number of siblings you have.
3. A `float` representing your height in feet (see if you can figure out the math to get the correct decimal portion!).
4. A `bool` that represents whether you are hungry at the current moment.

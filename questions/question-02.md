# 2022 Code Challenge - Question 02 - Displaying Data

## Explanation 

Displaying data on the screen is important when you're programming. In Python, we display
data using the `print()` function. You send data into the function inside the `()`.

Here's an example of how to use `print()` to display data on the screen:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
print(42)
print(3.14)
print(True)  # Remember, this is a `bool`, it doesn't need quotes.
```

## Exercise

Using what you've learned in the *Explanation* above, display the following text on the screen:

```text

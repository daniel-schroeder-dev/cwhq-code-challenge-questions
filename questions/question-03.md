2022 Code Challenge - Question 02

## Explanation

To allow your program to *remember* data, you can create a variable to store 
information. Variables are like name tags given to a piece of raw data.

Consider the raw data below. Do you know what each piece of data represents?

```python
36
True
"Curriculum Developer"
6.1
```

Using a variable, we can give a *name* to each piece of data that lets the programmer
know what the data represents. You create a variable using the assignment operator (`=`).

Here are the same pieces of data from the example above with good variable names:

```python
my_age = 36
is_hungry = True
current_job = "Curriculum Developer"
height_in_feet = 6.1
```

## Exercise

Using what you've learned in the above *Explanation*, create the following variables:
- A `first_name` variable that references a `str` representing your first name.
- An `is_sleepy` variable that references a `bool` representing whether you're tired or not right now.
- A `num_pets` variable that references an `int` representing the number of pets you currently have.
- A `pi` variable that references the mathematical constant PI to 4 decimal places.

## Answer

```python
first_name = "Daniel"
is_sleepy = True
num_pets = 1
pi = 3.1416
```

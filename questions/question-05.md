# 2022 Code Challenge - Question 05 - Basic Arithmetic

## Explanation

Computers are really good at math, and Python makes working with mathematical expressions
easy! 

The standard arithmetic operators are:
- `+` for addition
- `-` for subtraction
- `/` for division (always produces a `float`)
- `*` for multiplication

Here's an example of each operator in use:

```python
3 + 3
4 - 2
8 / 2
10 * 3
```

## Exercise

Using what you've learned in the *Explanation*, use each arithmetic operator once in the form:
- `operand` `operator` `operand`

> Note that an `operand` represents a number and the `operator` represents one of the four arithmetic
operators.

# 2022 Code Challenge - Question 10 

## Explanation

All of the exercises and programs we've encountered so far have run once
and then exited. Is this how all computer programs work? Have you ever
used a computer program that runs until something happens or until you
choose to exit?

To allow a program to run for an *indefinite* amount of time, programmers
use a `while` loop. The `while` loop will run until a given condition
becomes `False` or a `break` statement occurs in the loop body. Below, you'll
see a few examples of `while` loops in action.

```python
